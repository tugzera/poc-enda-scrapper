<h3><a name="_Toc96951920"></a><a name="_Toc106618998"></a>16.3.1 Review of literature related to Friedreich ataxia</h3>
<p>There is only one published study that specifically examines the prescription of wheelchairs for people with FRDA (2). This prospective two‐year randomized crossover study included 19 male participants, four of whom had been diagnosed with FRDA, although the method of diagnosis was not reported (the study predated genetic diagnosis). This study examined the efficacy of provision of a customized wheelchair seating system on sitting posture, respiration and upper limb function. While having some methodological shortcomings, this study is important in highlighting how critical adaptive seating is to an improved seated posture. There was, however, little immediate effect on respiratory function and only small differences in upper limb function. An important conclusion from this study was the potential to over‐correct musculoskeletal changes, and moreover, in the process of correction for deformity, to further compromise functional capacity. The study findings reinforce that in prescribing a manual wheelchair and seating system, it is essential that functional capacity is not impeded for the sake of an anatomically correct seated posture (2, 16). No new studies specifically relating to prescription of wheelchairs for people with FRDA have been identified for inclusion in the updated clinical management guidelines. However, most clinicians treating individuals with FRDA support this notion.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc96951921"></a><a name="_Toc106618999"></a>16.3.2 Review of literature from like conditions</h3>
<p>As with FRDA there are few documented studies evaluating the efficacy of wheelchair and customized seating in people with like chronic neurological conditions. There are however, retrospective audits (17), review articles (18, 19) and clinical guidelines (20).</p>
<p>People with FRDA usually present with some degree of scoliosis with associated hypertrophy of back musculature, and pelvic asymmetry. Uncorrected, this can lead to further loss of function, pain, pressure areas and compromised respiratory function (21, 22). Provision of an adjustable contoured seat that has the flexibility to correct pelvic asymmetry by the use of gel or foam inserts can be effective in preventing further deformity (20, 21, 23, 24). Moreover, the use of a contoured padded back support with either or both pelvic and thoracic lateral supports can assist in providing support in a coronal plane (22, 25). Holmes and colleagues (22) identified the efficacy of using four adjustable lateral pads in managing scoliosis related to cerebral palsy (CP). Whilst the mechanisms of scoliosis in people with FRDA have some differences to those with CP, the intervention may prove just as effective. A correctly positioned four-point lap belt can maintain the person in an optimum position despite a tendency to change position as a response to coughing, laughing or sneezing. De Sousa &amp; Frank (24) describe the prescription of tilt-in-space wheelchairs for people with rare diseases to help manage problematic pain and scoliosis. Consideration should be given to the most appropriate type of wheelchair frame (18). Whilst people with FRDA benefit from a lightweight, responsive model (often with a rigid frame), it is essential it has the strength to manage at times poorly controlled, forceful movement (18, 26, 27). Removable footplates are critical to ensure an optimum sit to stand stance during a standing transfer. Likewise, the use of one‐piece lift-off footplates may prove easier to remove and replace as well as achieving optimum positioning for hips, knees and feet.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc96951922"></a><a name="_Toc106619000"></a>16.3.3 Provision of powered wheelchairs and scooters</h3>
<p>Individuals with FRDA may benefit from provision of either a powered wheelchair or scooter. This equipment is particularly important in facilitating community access for those who find it difficult to wheel distances in a manual wheelchair (28). As discussed previously, careful attention needs to be given to appropriate seating, in addition to the programming, control, stability and storage of the chair and the mode of transfer on and off the chair or scooter (17). In one study (24), there was recognition that whilst some people with FRDA may lose the ability to control their powered wheelchair, many do not and are able to continue to use the wheelchair with standard controls. Modifications to the controls may allow appropriate responsiveness despite a reduction in upper limb co-ordination or strength. With either manual or powered wheelchairs, it is critical that structured training programs are conducted to ensure the user is safe, competent and confident to use the wheelchair (29). It is also important to consider the transportation of a powered wheelchair, particularly if needing to access more distant destinations where modifications to a car would be necessary.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc96951923"></a><a name="_Toc106619001"></a>16.3.4 Pediatric versus adult individuals with Friedreich ataxia</h3>
<p>It should be noted that the prescription of wheelchairs for children with FRDA raises different issues than those for adults. An earlier age of onset is associated with faster rate of progression to wheelchair use (30, 31). In addition, the repeat size on GAA1 has been associated with the presence of scoliosis, wheelchair dependence, impaired vibration sense and presence of foot deformity (32). The earlier scoliosis is evident, the greater is the likelihood of progression and requirement for surgical intervention (21). Prophylactic management of scoliosis in children is critical even before symptoms are apparent. The goal of seating in both pediatric and adult populations, regardless of evidence of scoliosis, is to maintain the spine in a balanced position in the coronal and sagittal planes over an even pelvis (21). Prescribing a wheelchair for a child has to incorporate requirements for training, growth, postural stability, completion of activities of daily living and school/leisure/home access issues (19).</p>
