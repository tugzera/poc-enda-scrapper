<h2 id="9-3">9.3 Management strategies for foot deformity in Friedreich ataxia</h2>

<h3 id="9-3-1">9.3.1 Surgery</h3>
<p>There is little evidence to support the efficacy of orthopedic surgery for individuals with foot issues with Friedreich ataxia; however, expert opinion suggests surgery may be considered if it would assist in foot alignment to facilitate mobility and/or safe and effective transfers. In weighing up the advantages and disadvantages of foot surgery, the risk of infection, pain associated with the procedure, risk of loss of mobility in the post-operative recovery phase, sensory issues in managing post-operative casts/immobilization (if indicated), and the risk of intraoperative complications such as fluid loss/overload and associated cardiac issues should be considered.</p>
<h3 id="9-3-2">9.3.2 Ankle foot orthotics</h3>
<p>Previous guidelines indicate that ankle foot orthotics (AFOs) may be appropriate for people with FRDA to provide mediolateral stability at the ankle in stance phase, facilitate toe clearance in swing phase, promote heel strike at initial contact, prevent foot deformity, support normal joint alignment and biomechanics, improve range of motion and to facilitate function (25, 26).</p>

<p>There are no studies specifically looking at orthotic prescription for people with FRDA; however, there are multiple studies describing the benefits of AFO prescription in improving postural security and movement, increasing weight-bearing percentage, improving knee control, reducing toe clawing, improving gait parameters, and improving standing and balance in individuals with other neurological conditions, such as stroke and spastic cerebral palsy (25-30).<br>
