<h3 id="1-1-1">1.1.1 Symptom onset and presenting symptoms</h3>
<p>The disease which came to be known as Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) (1) was first described by the German pathologist Nikolaus Friedreich in a series of five papers published between 1863 and 1877 (2-6). At the time, Friedreich described a new hereditary spinal disease associated with kyphoscoliosis and fatty degeneration of the heart. The disease is most often caused by a pathogenic expansion in the first intron of the frataxin gene (7) and the size of the expansion influences the clinical presentation. Typically, the disease begins in early adolescence with gait instability (8). Scoliosis may also be the initial symptom, especially in patients with a younger age of onset (8).</p>
<h3 id="1-1-2">1.1.2 Diagnostic criteria</h3>
<p>The first set of diagnostic criteria for FRDA were proposed by Geoffroy and colleagues in 1976 (9). Seven primary signs and symptoms were considered obligatory for diagnosis: onset before the end of puberty and never after the age of 20; ataxia of gait; progression of ataxia within the last two years; dysarthria; decrease of joint position and/or vibration sense in lower limbs; muscle weakness; and deep tendon areflexia in the lower limbs. Four clinical features were considered secondary, but not obligatory for diagnosis: extensor plantar response; pes cavus; scoliosis; and cardiomyopathy. These criteria, however, proved to be difficult to use in younger individuals in whom some of the features deemed to be obligatory, such as muscle weakness and sensory loss, would develop later. To overcome this challenge, Anita Harding proposed a new set of criteria (10). Obligatory criteria included an onset of symptoms before the age of 25, progressive unremitting ataxia of the limbs and gait, as well as absence of the knee and ankle jerks. Dysarthria and extensor plantar responses were considered important secondary criteria.</p>
<p>While diagnostic criteria have been critical to guide research and clinical care, they restricted the expected presentation of individuals with FRDA. The identification of the genetic basis of the disease (7) has led to a significant expansion of clinical phenotypes associated with FRDA. The limitations of the criteria rapidly became apparent as genetically confirmed individuals had onset after the age of 25 or with retained tendon reflexes (11, 12). In fact, the phenotype of late-onset FRDA is often predominantly spasticity with very little ataxia (13).</p>
<h3 id="1-1-3">1.1.3 Incidence and progression of clinical features</h3>
<h4>Neurological signs and symptoms</h4>
<p>In longitudinal studies, the neurological symptoms progress over time. Loss of ambulation obviously has a significant impact on independence and quality of life. For individuals with disease onset before the age of 15, loss of ambulation occurs on average 11.5 years after disease onset with the sequential loss of stance with feet apart and eyes closed, followed by stance with feet together and, finally, normal stance (14). Dysarthria is a nearly universal feature in FRDA (11, 12, 15) and spectral measures can detect changes in speech over time (16). The prevalence and frequency of ocular square-wave jerks increases over time, but this rarely translates into functional impairment (17). Overall, using the Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS), the disease seems to progress faster in younger individuals (18). While disease progression may indeed slow down with time, this could also reflect the limitations of clinical scales currently in use.</p>
<h4>Neurogenic bladder</h4>
<p>Lower urinary tract symptoms, including hesitancy, retention, urgency, and incontinence, have been reported in 59% to 82% of individuals with FRDA (19, 20).</p>
<h4>Orthopedic involvement</h4>
<p>In cohorts with genetically confirmed FRDA, between 60% and 84% have scoliosis (11, 12, 15, 21). Pes cavus, which is slightly less frequent, is also observed in a majority of individuals with FRDA (11, 12, 15, 21).</p>
<h4>Cardiac involvement and diabetes mellitus</h4>
<p>Heart involvement in FRDA has been described by Nikolaus Friedreich in his original series of publications and cardiac disease is recognized as the most common cause of mortality in FRDA (22). In fact, in addition to GAA repeat length, left ventricular mass index and left ventricular ejection fraction are independent predictors of mortality (23). ECG abnormalities such as T-wave inversions are found in 83% of individuals with FRDA (12). While 78.6% of people with FRDA exhibit normal left ventricular function, ejection fraction declines slowly over time even if it remains within the normal range (23).</p>
<p>Diabetes mellitus is another significant issue associated with FRDA and often requires insulin therapy; prevalence has been estimated to be between 8% and 32% (11, 12, 15).</p>
<h4>Visual impairment and hearing loss</h4>
<p>While clinically significant visual loss is reported in a minority of people with FRDA, anterior and posterior visual pathway involvement is nearly universal (24). Hearing loss is also increased in FRDA relative to the general population, and abnormal speech perception has been described in up to 90% of people with FRDA (25).</p>
