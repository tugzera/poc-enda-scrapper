<h1>3.8 Lower urinary tract and bowel function in Friedreich ataxia</h1>

<p>This chapter describes the effects of Friedreich ataxia on lower urinary tract and bowel function, the prevalence and pattern of lower urinary tract and bowel dysfunction in people with Friedreich ataxia, and strategies for managing disturbance of lower urinary tract and bowel function. In making recommendations for management, the authors were tasked with answering the question:</p>
<p><strong>For individuals with Friedreich ataxia, what management strategies could be implemented for disturbance of bladder and bowel function?</strong></p>
<h2 id="3-8-1">3.8.1 Overview of lower urinary tract dysfunction in Friedreich ataxia</h2>
<h3 id="3-8-1-1">3.8.1.1 Prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms</h3>
<p>From the limited data available, lower urinary tract (LUT) symptoms appear to be a common problem in people with Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), most commonly urinary storage symptoms (1, 2). Lad and colleagues demonstrated a high prevalence of 80% using validated questionnaires (1). Delatycki and colleagues (3) observed that 41% of a cohort of individuals with FRDA from eastern Australia with homozygous FXN intron 1 GAA expansions reported LUT symptoms, and this did not correlate with the size of the gene mutation. Durr and colleagues (4) noted a prevalence of 23% in their cohort of 140 people.</p>
<h3 id="3-8-1-2">3.8.1.2 Pattern of lower urinary tract dysfunction in Friedreich ataxia</h3>
<p>Information about the pattern of LUT dysfunction in individuals with FRDA is sparse. It has been established that symptoms tend to correlate with disease duration (3). Vezina and colleagues (5) observed that individuals with FRDA most often reported overactive bladder symptoms, with urgency incontinence being the commonest. The problem is made worse when mobility is affected and it is difficult to reach and transfer to the toilet in time. More recent data derived from the Collaborative Clinical Research Network (CCRN) in FRDA sheds light into the extent of LUT symptoms. Amongst 578 individuals included in this database, urgency was reported in 31% and incontinence in 27%. Ninety-one (16%) people reported frequent urinary incontinence (greater than once a week), amongst whom two required catheterization and 28% reported that bladder problems had altered their activities. However, only 13% were on medications for LUT symptoms (Cooperative Clinical Research Network in Friedreich Ataxia, J Farmer, D Lynch, and A Brocht, unpublished observations).</p>
<p>The overactive bladder is the most common presentation of LUT dysfunction in FRDA. This is a result of the detrusor muscle of the bladder contracting involuntarily and unpredictably. Urodynamic studies demonstrate different changes during the storage phase, including uninhibited contractions (detrusor overactivity) and reduced bladder capacity (2, 5, 6). These changes presumably reflect pyramidal tract involvement in FRDA (7). During the voiding phase of urodynamics, detrusor underactivity has been demonstrated (2). The commonest finding in needle electromyography (EMG) of the external urethral sphincter is complete voluntary relaxation (5). The risk of upper urinary tract damage is low, and though Musegante&nbsp;and colleagues reported that 14% of individuals were found to have dilatation of the upper urinary tract in ultrasonography, none had altered creatinine levels (2).</p>
<h2 id="3-8-2">3.8.2 Management of lower urinary tract dysfunction</h2>
<h3 id="3-8-2-1">3.8.2.1 Literature review</h3>
<p>An extensive literature search did not uncover any publications that specifically addressed the management of LUT symptoms in FRDA. Therefore, the guidelines proposed are based on limited understanding of the pathophysiology of LUT dysfunction in individuals with FRDA reported in a cross-sectional observational study (1) (level IV evidence). Urological issues in people with FRDA should be managed by a suitably trained healthcare professional who is knowledgeable about the ataxias and neurogenic LUT dysfunction. In most cases, LUT symptoms can be successfully managed using a bedside algorithm which has been adopted from treatment guidelines for managing LUT dysfunction in patients with multiple sclerosis (see Figure 3.8.1) (8).</p>
<h3 id="3-8-2-2">3.8.2.2 Evaluation of lower urinary tract symptoms</h3>
<p>The first step when evaluating LUT symptoms in people with FRDA is to test for a urinary tract infection (UTI) (8, 9). UTIs can mimic overactive bladder symptoms and can themselves worsen neurological symptoms (10).</p>
<p>The initial assessment should also include assessment of post micturition residual urine, before antimuscarinic medications are started. This measurement can be made by either using ultrasound or in-out catheterization. Urodynamic studies are not routinely performed unless LUT symptoms are refractory to treatment or intravesical treatment is being planned. Other urological/gynecological causes for LUT symptoms such as prostate enlargement or stress incontinence should be appropriately ruled out.</p>
<h3 id="3-8-2-3">3.8.2.3 Management of LUT symptoms</h3>
<p>The algorithm in Figure 3.8.1 outlines the management of LUT symptoms. Practical advice should be provided about cutting down caffeine, fizzy drinks and alcohol, as well as information about timed voiding and bladder retraining whenever appropriate. The fluid intake should be individualized, particularly taking into consideration possible concurrent cardiac issues; however, a fluid intake of between 1 to 2 liters a day is recommended (8). Pelvic floor exercises may be helpful especially when symptoms are mild.</p>
<p>Most individuals with FRDA and overactive bladder symptoms will require antimuscarinic medications (see Table 3.8.1 for a list of medications). The most often experienced side effects are dry mouth and constipation. If the former is too uncomfortable, then artificial saliva may be prescribed, in either tablet or spray form.</p>
<p>Antimuscarinic medications can increase heart rate, which may be relevant in a patient with cardiomyopathy. Cognitive problems can occur in FRDA (7), and in the rare situation where cognitive impairment is a feature, antimuscarinics should be prescribed with caution. In this setting, it would be sensible to use more selectively-acting medications such as trospium or darifenacin. If symptoms continue to be refractory, beta-3 receptor agonists such as mirabegron, percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation or intradetrusor injections of botulinum toxin A are options that could be considered.</p>

<p>From the literature, voiding dysfunction and incomplete bladder emptying apparently occur uncommonly in people with FRDA. In individuals with persistently elevated post-void residual (PVR) volumes in excess of 100 mL, clean intermittent self-catheterization (CISC) is indicated. This should be taught by a urology specialist nurse or continence advisor. However, manual dexterity, truncal balance, cognitive function and vision would need to be considered when assessing suitability for CISC. With advancing disease, an indwelling catheter, preferably suprapubic, may be necessary.</p>
<p>Referral to specialist urology services is indicated in cases of hematuria; suspicion of a concomitant urological condition, e.g. prostatic enlargement; frequent urinary tract infections; and symptoms refractory to medical management. Referral should also be made when considering intradetrusor injections of botulinum toxin A or suprapubic catheter insertion.</p>

<h3 id="3-8-2-4">3.8.2.4 Management of recurrent urinary tract infection</h3>
<p>Recurrent UTIs significantly impact the quality of life of individuals with neurological disorders and is one of the important causes for non-elective hospital admissions in patients with neurodegenerative disorders (11). There are no published studies evaluating the burden of recurrent UTIs in individuals with FRDA, or its management. In general, management of LUT dysfunction should be optimized and structural causes for UTIs, such as bladder stones or foreign bodies, should be excluded (12). The diagnostic evaluation includes ultrasonography of the urinary tract, urodynamic testing and cystoscopy. Other possible sources of infection should be considered, and bowel management and catheterization technique should be assessed and optimized if necessary.</p>
<p>Current literature does not support the routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis due to the lack of efficacy and increase in antimicrobial resistance. Recently, the concept of weekly oral cycling antibiotics appeared to show promising results in decreasing the incidence of UTI in spinal cord-injured patients without severe adverse events and colonization with multidrug-resistant bacteria (13), but further studies are warranted to see if these results can be replicated in the FRDA population. Several promising non-antibiotic options for UTI prophylaxis have also been developed, but further well-designed studies are similarly necessary to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these approaches in FRDA.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc105160010"></a>3.8.3 Overview of bowel function in Friedreich ataxia</h2>
<h3><a name="_Toc105160011"></a>3.8.3.1 Prevalence</h3>
<p>Symptoms of bowel dysfunction are common in individuals with FRDA and a prevalence of 64% was reported in an observational study (1). Symptoms including constipation and fecal incontinence are also prevalent in the general population (14, 15).</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc105160012"></a>3.8.3.2 Effects of Friedreich ataxia on bowel function</h3>
<p>The spinal neurodegeneration of FRDA would be expected to result in gut symptomatology, in an analogous way to the symptoms that develop in patients with spinal cord injury (16). The etiology of these symptoms is complex; there may be autonomic and pelvic nerve dysfunction (with attenuation of voluntary motor function and impaired anorectal sensation and anorectal reflexes), or generalized systemic factors (e.g., altered diet and behavior, impaired mobility, psychological disturbances or drug adverse effects) (17).</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc105160013"></a>3.8.4 Management of bowel dysfunction</h2>
<p>The mainstay of current treatment is adopting a conservative approach and optimizing the mechanics of defecation through the use of laxatives and irrigation approaches (18). When successful, this approach improves both evacuation and incontinence symptoms, with associated improvements in quality of life and independence. Future therapies may be directed at modulating pelvic innervation through electrical stimulation.</p>
<p>Bowel symptoms in FRDA are frequently reported. Evaluation of bowel function should form part of the routine care of an individual with FRDA. Currently the etiology underlying reported bowel dysfunction is not clear. Studies aiming at understanding the pathophysiology of bowel symptoms in FRDA are urgently needed. The best practice statements and recommendation outlined here are based on experience and data from similar but distinct conditions. Studies evaluating the management of bowel dysfunction in people with FRDA would strengthen these recommendations.</p>
