5.1 Management strategies for monitoring cardiac function peri-operatively

The increased thickness of the left ventricle in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) results in a reduction in coronary flow reserve and less tolerance to tachycardia. The reduced size of the left ventricular (LV) cavity in FRDA means a greater reliance on heart rate to maintain cardiac output and a reduction in stroke volume reserve. Hearts of individuals with FRDA will therefore have less tolerance for changes in hemodynamics, such as bradycardia, tachycardia, low blood pressure, and increases or decreases in LV filling.
Individuals with FRDA undergoing major surgery, such as scoliosis repair, should undergo EKG, echocardiography and have a cardiology consultation within a reasonable time frame prior to the surgery (e.g., 2 to 4 months prior) to evaluate LV structure and left ventricular ejection fraction. Because of the increased risk of cardiovascular instability and complications during major surgery in FRDA, a multi-disciplinary approach to evaluate and manage these patients during and after surgery is recommended. This may include consultation and collaboration between the cardiologist, anesthesiologist, intensivist and surgeon. Access to an intensive care unit capable of supporting a patient with severe heart failure is also recommended.
