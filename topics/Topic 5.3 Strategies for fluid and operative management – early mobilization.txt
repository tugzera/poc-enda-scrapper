5.3 Strategies for fluid and operative management – early mobilization

Low mobility levels are prevalent in the hospitalized adult population (5). The negative consequence of prolonged bed rest affecting the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, renal, endocrine and nervous systems are well documented (6). Prolonged immobility is associated with adverse outcomes such as functional decline, prolonged length of hospital stay, falls and an increased risk of mortality (5). ‘Standard post-operative management’ in regards to mobilization can vary considerably across settings and institutions. Early mobilization would involve a patient participating in out-of-bed activity as early as possible once deemed medically appropriate.
The complex presentation of individuals with FRDA may affect the confidence of therapists and staff in assessing and mobilizing this cohort, thus placing them at greater risk of low mobility levels in hospital. However, the complex clinical features of FRDA and the decreased strength reserve predispose this population to deconditioning and deterioration in physical functioning with prolonged immobility. Should this occur, the consequences for this already physically compromised population can be devastating.
Early mobilization is recommended to promote maintenance of physical functioning and independence during and after hospitalization. The potential positive effects of early mobilization include maintenance of mobility and physical ability to optimize a return to pre-surgical functional and independence status. Ensuring appropriate physical support and assistance, environmental set-up and equipment requirements both within the hospital setting and after discharge may mitigate the effects of post-surgical immobilization. However, the resources, hospital staff assistance and care-giver support required to facilitate early mobilization need to be considered.
