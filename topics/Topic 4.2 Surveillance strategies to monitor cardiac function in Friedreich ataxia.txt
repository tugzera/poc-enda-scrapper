4.2 Surveillance strategies to monitor cardiac function in Friedreich ataxia

It is recommended that all individuals with a diagnosis of FRDA have an EKG and echocardiogram performed as part of their initial evaluation and that the EKG and echocardiogram are repeated at least yearly thereafter, irrespective of the initial findings. Cardiology consultation should be considered for all individuals with FRDA, but is definitely indicated if there are cardiac symptoms or an abnormality on the EKG. Although there is much current interest in cardiology in the measurement of strain and left ventricular long-axis strain is reduced in FRDA at an early stage in the disease course (39), the role of routine measurement of long-axis strain by either echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance in FRDA is unclear. Similarly, cardiac magnetic resonance studies have demonstrated that there can be focal myocardial fibrosis in the left ventricular myocardium in FRDA based on the presence of LGE (11, 19, 59, 60), but whether this finding provides clinically useful information in FRDA is unknown.
