<h2 id="5-4">5.4 Strategies for fluid and operative management â€“ anesthesia</h2>


<p>Peri-operative pain management is a concern in managing people with FRDA. Surgeries and associated anesthesia may be required to treat cardiac, orthopedic and obstetric issues. However, diabetes mellitus, cardiomyopathy and compromised pulmonary function make anesthetic management challenging.</p>
<p>While practice guidelines have not been established, there are case reports of successful anesthesia using remifentanil and propofol (7), alfentanil and propofol (8), and isoflurane (3) in individuals with FRDA. Use of muscle relaxants has been reported with mixed results in individuals with FRDA and there has been one report of hypersensitivity to tubocurarine (9). A more recent report by Schmitt et al (10) described the response of two adolescent girls with FRDA to rocuronium. In particular, the clinical duration of rocuronium for both girls was comparable to children without neuromuscular disease, indicating successful anesthetic management (10). Other reports describe a normal or near normal response to various nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, such as tubocurarine, atracurium and vecuronium (11, 12). Schmitt and colleagues (10) recommend accurate assessment of neuromuscular block throughout anesthesia for individuals with FRDA. In the case of obstetrics, successful use of fentanyl and bupivacaine has been reported in a case of a vaginal delivery (13) and a caesarean section (14). More recently, Ozgul and colleagues reported the successful anesthetic management of a person who underwent posterior spinal fusion (15).</p>
<p>A related review of the effects of anesthesia in individuals with a variety of muscular dystrophies (which did not include people with FRDA) reports cardiac complications associated with inhaled anesthetics and post-operative rhabdomyolysis (16). The authors recommend avoiding use of succinylcholine which has been associated with life-threatening hyperkalemia (16). This recommendation may also be applicable to individuals with FRDA.</p>
<p>Finally, changes to cardiac function in people with FRDA indicate the capacity to tolerate lower blood pressure and large fluid shift as may be associated with surgery and anesthesia may be compromised. It is important to carefully monitor fluid loss and cardiovascular function during extensive surgery in FRDA (17).</p>
