<h1>3.7 Vision in Friedreich ataxia</h1>

<p>This chapter describes the effects of Friedreich ataxia on vision, the functional consequences of disturbance of vision, and strategies for managing disturbance of vision. In making recommendations for management, the authors were tasked with answering the question:</p>
<p><strong>For individuals with Friedreich ataxia, what management strategies could be implemented for disturbance of vision?</strong></p>
<h2 id="3-7-1">3.7.1 The effects of Friedreich ataxia on vision</h2>
<p>Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) leads to decreased ability to see based on loss of cells that give rise to the optic nerve. This leads to loss of peripheral vision, color vision and varying degrees of loss of central vision, from slight vision loss in some to complete blindness in the most affected individuals. FRDA-related vision loss is not related to diabetes; diabetic visual dysfunction is important to rule out and has its own separate issues.</p>

<p>Visual abilities have been measured both functionally using techniques such as low contrast letter acuity (3) and anatomically using optical coherence tomography (OCT) (4, 7). OCT is a non-invasive, high resolution technique that quantifies the thickness of ocular structures, particularly the retinal nerve fiber layer, and can generate a complete picture of anatomic structure of the retina. OCT has demonstrated that a significant number of people with FRDA have thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer (7). However, this thinning is not always clearly reflected in overt visual dysfunction (as measured by visual acuity testing), suggesting that not all retinal abnormalities manifest clinically.</p>
<p>Individuals with FRDA classified as having “classical” or late-onset forms of the disease can all experience loss in visual function. When tested using low-contrast visual acuity, loss of visual function correlates with poorer scores on neurologic exams such as the FARS (3). This demonstrates that more severely affected individuals are also more likely to develop decreased visual acuity. The loss of visual function is not as strongly associated with age of onset; thus, individuals with symptom onset at any age can develop vision loss at later stages of disease progression.</p>
<p>Efferent visual abnormalities are less commonly discussed in FRDA, perhaps because they contribute less to dysfunction. They include primarily fixation abnormalities (ocular flutter, square wave jerks), and to a lesser extent nystagmus or saccadic abnormalities. Efferent visual abnormalities are traditional diagnostic features of FRDA but have less need for therapy in the overall context of the disorder. Despite 20:20 vision, people with FRDA may report reduced visual quality of life as reported by Fahey and colleagues (1).</p>
<h2 id="3-7-2">3.7.2 Functional consequences of disturbance of vision</h2>
<p>Visual impairment may lead to difficulty performing all visually guided tasks such as driving, eating, using limbs for precise movements and reading.</p>
<h2 id="3-7-3">3.7.3 Management of visual disturbance</h2>
<p>There are no approved treatments or proposed treatments for vision loss in FRDA. The only strategy is to optimize vision in other ways: proper refraction, using magnification on tasks requiring visual control and consultation with low vision specialists.</p>
