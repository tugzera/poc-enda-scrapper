<h1>3.11 Cognitive function in Friedreich ataxia</h1>

<p>This chapter describes the effects of Friedreich ataxia on cognitive function, the functional consequences of these effects, and recommendations for managing disturbance of cognitive function. In making recommendations, the authors were tasked with answering the question:</p>
<p><strong>For individuals with Friedreich ataxia, what management strategies could be implemented for disturbance of cognitive function?</strong></p>
<h2 id="3-11-1">3.11.1 The effects of Friedreich ataxia on cognitive function</h2>
<p>Cognition in Friedreich Ataxia (FRDA) is not as well studied as motor, sensory and gait disorders, and individuals with FRDA and their caregivers have low awareness of potential cognitive impairment (1). Past decades have unveiled a prominent role of the cerebellum and its efferent tracts, emerging from the cerebellum dentate nuclei (DN), in perception, higher cortical functions and affect modulation (2, 3). In regards to pathology, FRDA is hallmarked by progressive cerebellar DN atrophy (4). Thus, DN pathology in FRDA could have an impact on various domains of cognition through cerebello-cortical loops dysfunction.</p>
<p>Seminal investigations showed lower, but within normal limits, cognitive performance in individuals with FRDA compared to controls (5-7) and contemporary studies have reported normal mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores (8-13) and slightly abnormal MOntreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) scores (14, 15). Yet, studies based on thorough neuropsychological evaluation found that individuals with FRDA displayed significant differences in almost all spheres of cognition, when specifically evaluated, compared to control participants.</p>
<p>Language fluencies are the most studied and individuals with FRDA show lower phonemic (12, 14-18) and semantic (7-9, 11, 15, 18, 19) fluencies, as well as lower action verbal fluencies (8, 9, 11) than controls. Attentional and executive function, measured by the Stroop Interference Test (8, 13, 20-23) or the trail making test (13, 15, 20, 23, 24) are also less efficient, and digit span assessment highlights poorer digit span forward (7, 11, 15, 16, 25-27) and backward (7, 11, 16, 25-27) recall. Similarly, memory assessments in individuals with FRDA show poorer performance in the California verbal learning test (11, 18, 27), the 10/36 spatial recall test (11, 18, 27) and in logical memory evaluations (11, 18) compared to controls. Visuospatial abilities, assessed in fewer studies, are also altered (6, 11, 12, 18, 19, 28).</p>

<h2 id="3-11-2">3.11.2 Functional consequences of disturbance of cognitive function</h2>
<p>In addressing the sensitive issue of cognitive function in people with FRDA it should be noted that the deficits described do not generally preclude a person with FRDA from participating in education at school and college/university, gaining meaningful and even cognitively demanding employment, partnering and raising a family (31). Cognitive disorders in FRDA are considered to be relatively subtle and do not cause obvious functional impairment, which explains why it is often overlooked (32). However, even if missed by classic screening tools, cognitive and affective impairments may affect the ability of individuals with FRDA to study, work and develop their full potential, both intellectually and socially. Thus, cognitive impairments should be considered when difficulties arise in any of those areas.</p>
<p>There is limited evidence on the potential progression of cognitive impairments in individuals with FRDA and dedicated studies are needed (1). Yet, there seems to be a correlation between structural alterations of the dentate nuclei, dentato-rubral tracts and posterior cerebellar lobes and cognitive performance (33, 34). Language fluency as well as attention and processing speed worsen over time (7, 8), and there is a relationship between the magnitude of cognitive impairment and ataxia severity (35). This suggests that cognitive impairment relates to cerebellar pathology in FRDA and that cognitive disorders may appear as the disease progresses, with a severity that is correlated with the extent of cerebellar ataxic symptoms.</p>
