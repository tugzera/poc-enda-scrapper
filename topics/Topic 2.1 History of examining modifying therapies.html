<h2 id="2-1">2.1 History of examining modifying therapies</h2>

<p>Since 1996, the year of the discovery of the genetic cause of Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), many pharmacological clinical trials have been conducted to explore potential medications and different strategies aimed at ameliorating or preventing cell damage due to reduced frataxin.</p>
<p>The first compounds tested in individuals with FRDA were medications that were already available – either supplements or drugs approved for other indications. Initially, medications used in clinical trials were compounds with antioxidant properties, including vitamin E, co-enzyme Q10 and idebenone. In particular, idebenone was the most tested drug, with numerous clinical trials conducted from 1998 to 2012. Administration of different dosages of idebenone was shown to be safe. However, the results of the most recent Phase III study did not confirm the efficacy of idebenone on neurological symptoms and it is still unclear whether idebenone provides any cardiac benefit (1).</p>

<p>Pioglitazone hydrochloride (ACTOS®, Takeda Pharmaceuticals) has also been proposed as a potential treatment for FRDA because it was postulated to induce the expression of many enzymes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, including the superoxide dismutases. Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione oral antidiabetic agent, which may cause or worsen congestive heart failure and other cardiovascular problems in FRDA (4). Its efficacy in the treatment of FRDA has not been demonstrated (5).</p>
<p>A different therapeutic strategy came from the observation of iron overload in mitochondria of individuals with FRDA (6). The commercially available iron chelator deferiprone (Ferriprox®, Apopharma, Canada) has been tested in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial (sponsored by Apopharma) of 72 individuals with FRDA aged 7 to 35 years (7). The participants assigned to the high-dose arm (60 mg/kg/day) were prematurely discontinued due to worsening of ataxia. Participants receiving 40 mg/kg/day also had worsening Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) and the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) scores, whereas participants receiving 20 mg/kg/day of deferiprone had no significant change in FARS, similar to the placebo-treated individuals. The lack of deterioration in the placebo arm impaired the ability to detect any potential protective effect of deferiprone. However, subgroup analyses in participants with less severe disease suggest a benefit of deferiprone at 20 mg/kg/day on ICARS, FARS, kinetic function, and 9-hole peg test (9HPT). Deferiprone-treated participants receiving 20 or 40 mg/kg/day showed a significant decline in the left ventricular mass index. Higher doses of deferiprone caused systemic iron depletion and anemia; however, only one participant treated with 20 mg/kg/day had to discontinue treatment because of this complication (7). The major risk with deferiprone is the sudden, idiosyncratic development of agranulocytosis, which may occur at any time, even after a few years of treatment. No cases of agranulocytosis occurred during this study, but one participant experienced neutropenia, which resolved upon discontinuation of deferiprone (7). This study suggests that systemic iron depletion is deleterious in people with FRDA, possibly further impairing iron sulfur cluster biogenesis, but a low dose of a membrane penetrant chelator such as deferiprone may be beneficial by removing excess redox-active iron.</p>
<p>An anecdotal observation of an improvement in balance and coordination in patients treated with varenicline (Champix®, Pfizer), an agonist of nicotine receptors, to help quit smoking suggested the potential use of this drug for individuals with FRDA. However, a Phase II pilot study was stopped before completion due to concerns on safety and observations of worsening gait and imbalance. There was also insufficient evidence of efficacy. A complete report detailing study data will be issued shortly.</p>

<p>Another drug tested for its property of increasing both frataxin messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels in a variety of cell types, including cells from individuals with FRDA, is the exogenous interferon gamma‐1b (ACTIMMUNE). This drug was administered at different dosages via subcutaneous injection in an open-label study design. The twelve children with FRDA who received the treatment for 12 weeks improved in FARS scores without a clear relationship to changes in frataxin levels (12). The following double-blind placebo-controlled study performed in a much larger series of individuals with FRDA (n = 92) did not demonstrate significant differences between interferon-treated and placebo-control groups after 6 months of treatment. No change was noted in buccal cell or whole blood frataxin levels (13).</p>
<p>Although a great scientific effort has been dedicated to selecting these drugs and testing their efficacy in clinical trials, most of these compounds have been removed from the list of potential therapeutic candidates for FRDA. While there is currently no approved pharmacological treatment for FRDA, research into potential therapeutic agents has nevertheless advanced considerably in the past two decades. There are many other potential therapeutic candidates that have been proposed in the treatment of FRDA that have undergone or are in the process of undergoing clinical trial evaluation.</p>
