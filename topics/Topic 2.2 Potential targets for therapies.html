<h2 id="2-2">2.2 Potential targets for therapies</h2>

<p>The research of therapies that could have clinically meaningful results leading to a cure for the disease is continuing, with new compounds and new clinical trials being designed, commenced and currently ongoing. The research of new strategies is still based on the evaluation of potential therapeutic effects of drugs that are already commercially available and approved for other diseases, as well as new compounds specifically intended for the cure of FRDA and not available for other indications.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-1">2.2.1 Therapies that decrease oxidative stress and enhance mitochondrial function</h3>
<p>The pathology of FRDA is characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, demonstrated in both cell and animal models of FRDA (6, 14). Respiratory chain dysfunction, accumulation of iron in the mitochondria and impaired antioxidant responses lead to increased production of reactive oxygen species (15). The use of antioxidants has therefore been investigated as a potential therapy for FRDA.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-2">2.2.2 Anti-inflammatory therapy</h3>
<p>Inflammation contributes to the pathology of FRDA and has been detected in animal models as well as in tissues of people with FRDA (16, 17). The anti-inflammatory properties of steroids may play a role in altering oxidative damage caused by frataxin deficiency. This hypothesis arose after an improvement in neurological symptoms was reported in an individual with FRDA following corticosteroid treatment (18). Methylprednisolone has thus been explored as a treatment in FRDA (19).</p>
<h3 id="2-2-3">2.2.3 Modulators of frataxin-controlled metabolic pathways</h3>
<p>FRDA is caused by the reduced expression of frataxin, a protein found mostly in the mitochondria (20, 21), where it acts as an activator of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biosynthesis. The resulting Fe-S deficiency impairs the activity of many cellular proteins, including respiratory chain subunits and Krebs cycle enzymes in the mitochondria, and triggers a homeostatic response that increases cellular and mitochondrial iron uptake (22). However, as the Fe-S cluster biosynthetic pathway is impaired, iron eventually accumulates in mitochondria where it may engage in redox reactions generating toxic free radicals, activate signaling pathways leading to neurodegeneration (23), and trigger cell death, in particular by ferroptosis (24).</p>
<p>It has been proposed that frataxin is also involved in various other pathways, including iron metabolism, transport and storage (25), as well as regulation of apoptosis (26). Furthermore, several metabolic pathways are perturbed because of frataxin deficiency, in particular those that control antioxidant responses and mitochondrial biogenesis. Therapies that modulate such pathways include nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activators and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-γ agonists.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-4">2.2.4 Therapies that increase FRDA gene expression</h3>

<h3 id="2-2-5">2.2.5 Frataxin replacement, stabilizers or enhancers</h3>

<h4>Gene replacement and editing</h4>
<p>Gene replacement therapy is perhaps the most promising in terms of correcting frataxin loss in FRDA, with numerous strategies currently being explored (<a href="https://curefa.org/pipeline">https://curefa.org/pipeline</a>). FRDA presents as a favorable candidate for gene replacement therapy due to several factors. About 96% of individuals with FRDA have the same single gene mutation which leads to gene silencing and a reduction of the frataxin protein levels. Because individuals with FRDA already produce frataxin, it is less likely that an immune response will be produced. Furthermore, while carriers for FRDA possess one faulty copy of the gene and produce half the normal frataxin levels, these individuals do not exhibit any symptoms, indicating that even a small increase of frataxin has the likelihood to be beneficial.</p>

<p>There are, however, several issues that need to be resolved before AAV-based gene therapy becomes a reality in FRDA. Some naturally occurring AAVs, such as AAV9, can effectively cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) after systemic administration, but only for a limited time after birth. For this reason, while AAV9-based gene therapy has been effective in treating diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), that affects babies, there are ongoing efforts to generate new capsids that can penetrate the CNS in older children and adults after systemic administration (39). However, this may require very high intravenous doses of the vector, which, at least in the case of AAV9 and related capsids, may trigger a severe reaction with liver toxicity and cytokine release. While this reaction could be potentially lethal, it is at least partially preventable with immune suppressive treatment with steroids (40). Furthermore, an inflammatory reaction with neuron loss in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) has been observed in some animal models (40). This is a particularly worrisome complication in FRDA, where DRG pathology is already present. Acquired immunity to AAVs, a common occurrence in the general population, is another problem, as neutralizing antibodies may inactivate the gene therapy vector and T cells may attack transfected cells presenting capsid fragments on their surface. This is also a major obstacle to re-administer AAV to patients who have previously received it. Overall, these difficulties impose the development of new capsids with improved biodistribution and ability to cross the BBB, as well as of strategies to control innate and acquired immune responses, allowing administration to individuals carrying anti-AAV antibodies and re-administration of a therapeutic vector if needed (41).</p>
<p>Proper control of transgene expression is also necessary. Frataxin expression must reach heterozygous carrier levels at least, but cannot be excessive, as it has demonstrated that very high levels are toxic, causing mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiac toxicity in mouse models (42). This requires a combination of appropriate vector biodistribution and promoter choice.</p>
<p>The possibility of dual routes of administration is an emerging option for what we may consider the first-generation gene therapy for FRDA, while “optimal” vectors are being developed. This approach aims at reaching peripheral organs (heart, pancreas, DRG, peripheral nerves, muscle) via a relatively low dose systemic administration, and the CNS via intrathecal or intraparenchymal administration, targeting key affected structures as the dentate nuclei in the cerebellum.</p>
<p>Other approaches may involve different viral vectors, such as Herpes virus-based, or non-viral vectors such as lipid nanoparticles. These are still in an early-preclinical phase.</p>
