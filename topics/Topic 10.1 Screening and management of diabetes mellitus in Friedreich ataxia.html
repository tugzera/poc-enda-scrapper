<h3 id="10-1-1">10.1.1 Friedreich ataxia and diabetes mellitus</h3>
<p>It has been known for nearly a century that individuals with Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) are at risk of developing diabetes (DM) (1, 2). Reported prevalence varies between 5% and 40% (3-6). The variability in estimates can, in part, be explained by the cohort evaluated, as well as the tests and thresholds that were used to diagnose DM. Clinically, FRDA-related DM may be under-recognized using current screening practices. In addition, many individuals with FRDA may not meet diagnostic criteria for DM on initial screening, but do have evidence of abnormal glucose metabolism when evaluated with more sensitive tests. For example, in one study of 41 individuals with FRDA without known DM who underwent oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT), 12% had DM, and 49% of participants had impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance (7). Finally, DM has been reported to be a presenting feature of FRDA, though rarely (8).</p>
<p>Consensus diagnostic criteria for any form of DM include hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48mmol/mol), fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), two-hour glucose after an OGTT ≥ 200mg/dL (11.1 mmol/l), or a random glucose ≥ 200mg/dL (11.1 mmol/l) in a patient with symptoms of hyperglycemia (9); these criteria are also appropriate for diagnosis of FRDA-related DM.</p>

<p>In FRDA, both insulin deficiency and insulin resistance have been implicated in the development of DM. The relative contribution of each of these processes may differ across the lifespan. Typically in children, FRDA-related DM may present acutely with diabetic ketoacidosis, the hallmark of clinically relevant insulin deficiency (14), and in some cases it can be fatal (15). This insulin-dependent ketosis-prone DM may be caused by non-autoimmune loss of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells (16). A few reports have described a decreased number of islets and beta cells in the pancreas in individuals with FRDA (7). Other studies found no difference in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in individuals with FRDA (17, 18), though diminished arginine-stimulated insulin release has been reported (18). The normal oscillatory insulin secretion pattern has been shown to be preserved in FRDA (19).</p>
<p>In addition to insulin deficiency, studies have pointed to defects in insulin action. Insulin resistance has been demonstrated at the whole body and the cellular level (in blood cells, muscle cells and liver cells) (7, 20-22). Insulin resistance may be present even in individuals with FRDA who are not obese as classified by body mass index, due to increased abdominal adiposity (7). Adults may have a more insidious onset of DM, consistent with slowly evolving insulin resistance and insulin deficiency, and may have initial abnormal glucose tolerance preceding overt DM (7). Most of the studies addressing the pathogenesis of DM in FRDA were conducted before the genetic cause of the disease was elucidated (23) and before important concepts in glucose homeostasis were established (24, 25). One of these crucial concepts is that insulin secretion is tightly regulated by insulin sensitivity (25, 26). Under physiological conditions, pancreatic beta cells increase insulin release as needed to maintain normal glucose tolerance. Thus, to interpret the insulin secretory response of the pancreatic beta cells correctly, it needs to be adjusted for insulin resistance (24, 27, 28). This approach has identified pancreatic beta cell dysfunction as central to the development of diabetes in FRDA (7).</p>
<h3 id="10-1-2">10.1.2 Screening for diabetes mellitus</h3>
<p>Screening tests for DM in general include measurements of fasting plasma glucose, random plasma glucose (in the setting of suggestive symptoms), HbA1c, and oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT). Compared with fasting glucose and HbA1c, the two-hour glucose level from an OGTT will result in more diagnoses of DM in the general population as well as FRDA-related DM, and also more diagnoses of pre-DM (29), a condition characterized by abnormal glucose metabolism that may herald future development of DM (9). In FRDA, impaired glucose tolerance from an OGTT has been detected in individuals with normal fasting glucose (7). While in some other diseases with a higher risk of DM, such as cystic fibrosis, there is a recommendation for annual OGTTs (30), there is currently not enough evidence to recommend this screening strategy in FRDA.</p>
<h3 id="10-1-3">10.1.3 Management of diabetes mellitus</h3>
<p>Treatment of autoimmune type 1 DM in individuals without FRDA relies on insulin (type 1 DM is due to near complete insulin deficiency) and for metabolic type 2 DM (caused by relative insulin deficiency in the setting of insulin resistance), insulin, metformin, and other glucose-lowering agents are used. FRDA-related DM has features of insulin deficiency, and in some individuals, particularly adults, also insulin resistance. Therefore, for children with FRDA-related DM and for adults with evidence of decreased insulin secretion (as evidenced by low-c-peptide, presence of ketones, or acute hyperglycemia), we recommend insulin as the primary treatment. For adults with FRDA-related DM with evidence of insulin resistance we suggest individualized application of management guidelines for type 2 DM, with particular consideration of the risks and benefits related to comorbidities of FRDA (31, 32). Newer anti-diabetic agents have not been tested in FRDA and there is significant heterogeneity in FRDA-related DM; therefore, a personalized approach is warranted.</p>
<h4>Insulin</h4>
<p>Most individuals with FRDA-related DM are currently managed with insulin. Insulin has glucose-lowering effects in individuals with all forms of DM, and is necessary in those with minimal insulin secretion. However, side effects such as hypoglycemia may occur; hence there is interest in considering the potential utility of other agents. Additionally, for individuals with excess weight where weight loss is recommended, insulin may make weight loss more difficult. In individuals with FRDA-related DM who may have decreased dexterity, we recommend using available technologies to aid with insulin administration (e.g., pens and pumps) and blood glucose monitoring (e.g., continuous glucose monitors) (33).</p>
<h4>Non-insulin treatments</h4>
<p>Possible risks and benefits of non-insulin glucose-lowering agents for individuals with FRDA are described below. It is important to remember that there is currently no evidence for or against their use specifically in FRDA, nor have there been FRDA-specific safety studies for non-insulin therapies. Full review of associated risks should be undertaken prior to use of these medications. Evidence for the described therapies comes from the treatment of other forms of DM and theoretical benefits of associated mechanisms of action.</p>
