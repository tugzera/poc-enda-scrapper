<h2 id="8-1">8.1 Overview of pain in Friedreich ataxia</h2>


<p>Individuals with Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) can experience pain from a variety of disease-related symptoms including neuropathy, spasms, and cardiac and orthopedic issues. When measured using a validated scale, pain has a significant impact on the quality of life of people with FRDA (1).</p>
<p>There are no systematic evaluations of the prevalence, severity or management of pain associated with FRDA and few case reports. Often, pain relief is achieved through treatment of the underlying cause; for example, treatment of orthopedic issues or muscle spasms. Cardiomyopathy is common in people with FRDA and chest pain can occur due to abnormal coronary vasculature (2). Chest pain as the first symptom of FRDA has also been reported in a 9-year-old child diagnosed with FRDA six years later (3). Spasticity can contribute to pain in individuals with FRDA. Even without clinical signs of spasticity, one individual was reported to have frequent painful extensor and flexor spasms that severely interfered with quality of life (4). These spasms persisted despite oral baclofen treatment but responded to intrathecal baclofen. Two other more recent case studies suggest Intrathecal baclofen may be of benefit to individuals with painful spasms (5, 6).</p>
