<h3 id="8-3-1">8.3.1 Non-neuropathic pain in Friedreich ataxia</h3>
<p>There is little published data about non-neuropathic pain in FRDA, and the prevalence of non-neuropathic pain in FRDA patients is unknown. Individuals with FRDA appear to suffer from pain, as indicated by symptom-specific scales (1, 13, 14). Specifically, non-neuropathic pain may originate from spasticity, cramping, musculoskeletal and orthopedic issues, scoliosis, injury, and chest pain due to cardiac dysfunction. Osteoarticular problems with associated inflammation may also contribute to non-neuropathic pain.</p>
<h3 id="8-3-2">8.3.2 Management of non-neuropathic pain</h3>
<p>The effect of non-neuropathic pain on individuals with FRDA appears to be under recognized and underreported. There is currently no cure for FRDA, and treatment remains symptomatic. Pain relief in neurological diseases may be accomplished by pharmacological therapy, focal injections of botulinum toxin for musculoskeletal issues, nerve blocks, physical therapy, spinal stimulators, and surgery for orthopedic issues. The efficacy of these treatments has not been reported extensively in rigorous studies.</p>
<p>Despite this, and as with neuropathic pain, non-neuropathic pain that interferes with a personâ€™s quality of life should be addressed and alleviated. Each treatment, from pharmacological to invasive, should be weighed according to risks and benefits. Caution should be exercised when using agents with potential cardiac side effects in the FRDA population. Although the recommendations for pain treatment in FRDA are cautious, this is due to a paucity of data rather than evidence that interventions are not efficacious. More research is needed to examine the role of pain in FRDA and the efficacy of various treatments.</p>
